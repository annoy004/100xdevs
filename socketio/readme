http is persistent??

Is HTTP Persistent?
👉 Short Answer:
HTTP by default is not fully persistent, but modern versions of HTTP (1.1 and 2) support persistent connections.

🔍 Let’s break it down:
1. HTTP/1.0 — ❌ Non-Persistent by Default
For every request (like fetching a CSS file, an image, etc.), a new TCP connection is opened and closed.

This is inefficient because it repeats the connection handshake multiple times.

2. HTTP/1.1 — ✅ Persistent by Default
Introduced persistent connections via the Connection: keep-alive header.

One connection can handle multiple requests/responses, reducing overhead.

Still not “fully persistent” — the connection will eventually timeout or close.

3. HTTP/2 — ✅ Fully Multiplexed
Uses a single persistent connection to send/receive multiple streams in parallel.

More efficient, true persistence during session (until closed or timed out).

🔄 However, HTTP is not stateful by default:
Even if the connection is persistent:

It does not remember who you are across requests.

You need cookies, sessions, or tokens to make it feel "stateful."

✅ Summary Table
HTTP Version	Persistent Connection	Notes
HTTP/1.0	❌ No (unless forced)	Requires Connection: keep-alive manually
HTTP/1.1	✅ Yes (by default)	Reuses connections
HTTP/2	✅ Yes (better)	Full multiplexing on one connection
Stateful	❌ No	Use sessions/cookies

🔧 Persistent ≠ Stateful
Persistent: Reuses the same connection.

Stateful: Remembers the user's session or context (which HTTP does not do inherently).

Let me know if you want a comparison between HTTP and WebSocket on persistence and state handling.

why should we not use http over web socket

Great question!

Let’s compare HTTP vs WebSocket and explain why HTTP is not a good fit for real-time, persistent communication — and when you should prefer WebSocket instead.

⚔️ HTTP vs WebSocket — Core Differences
Feature	HTTP	WebSocket
Protocol	Request-response (half-duplex)	Full-duplex (both ways)
Connection	Usually short-lived	Persistent, long-lived
Direction	Client initiates all communication	Both client and server can push
Latency	Higher	Low (no repeated handshakes)
Real-time updates	❌ Needs polling or long-polling	✅ Built for real-time
Overhead	High (headers per request)	Low (handshake once, small frames)

❌ Why Not Use HTTP for Real-Time Communication?
1. No Server Push
HTTP: Client must ask every time (polling).

❌ Not suitable for chat, stock tickers, multiplayer games, etc.

2. High Overhead
Each HTTP request sends headers again and again.

This wastes bandwidth and causes latency.

3. Not Truly Persistent
HTTP connection is short-lived (even with keep-alive).

Can't easily maintain state or identity over time.

4. Workarounds Get Messy
Using HTTP for real-time means:

Polling (wasteful and delayed)

Long-polling (complex and hacky)

Server-Sent Events (one-way only)

✅ When to Use WebSocket Instead
Use WebSocket when you need:

🔁 Two-way communication (e.g., chat apps, games)

⚡ Low latency updates (e.g., live dashboards)

📶 Persistent connection (e.g., collaborative tools, video calls)

🔔 Server-to-client push (e.g., notifications)

✅ When HTTP is Still Better
Use HTTP for:

Simple requests like form submissions, API calls

File uploads/downloads

SEO-friendly content (HTML pages)

Authentication (initial login)

🔚 Summary
Use Case	Use HTTP?	Use WebSocket?
Submit a form	✅ Yes	❌ No
Real-time chat	❌ No	✅ Yes
Live notifications	❌ No	✅ Yes
Periodic data polling	❌ No	✅ Yes
Static content delivery	✅ Yes	❌ No
